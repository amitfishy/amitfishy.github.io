# About Me

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Hello! My name is Amit Sinha and I'm currently in the final year of my PhD at McGill University under the supervision of Prof. [Aditya Mahajan](https://adityam.github.io/). I've also previously worked with [Matthieu Geist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ectPLEUAAAAJ&hl=en), [Jayakumar Subramanium](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayakumar-subramanian-9198954) and [Sarath Chandar](https://sarathchandar.in/).

# Research Interests

<p style="text-align:justify;">
My current research interests are centered around **reinforcement learning** for **partially observable systems** and **multi-agent team-based systems**.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
In other words, I consider how a complicated amalgam of information used by an automated decision making agent can be reduced to smaller, simpler and more efficient blocks of information; and subsequently how to use these efficient blocks of information to learn automated decision making strategies that satisfy some pre-defined utility.
